## Setup coverage badge

Below are examples of the badges you can use in your main branch `README` file.

### Direct image

[![Coverage badge](https://github.com/Alexander-Nestor-Bergmann/pytorch-transformer-demo/raw/python-coverage-comment-action-data/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Alexander-Nestor-Bergmann/pytorch-transformer-demo/tree/python-coverage-comment-action-data)

This is the one to use if your repository is private or if you don't want to customize anything.
